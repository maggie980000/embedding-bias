This report is organized as follows.
First, we will introduce 3 methods that aim to infer the word embeddings by solving 3 distinct optimization problems. 
Subsequently, we will train the embeddings on a particular vocabulary based on 2 different movie review corpora. We will then evaluate the obtained embeddings using 2 tasks: word similarity calculation and document sentiment classification.
Furthermore, we will compare the biases present in the embeddings towards sentiment words and the gender bias between the two corpora. Finally, we will interpret the learned embeddings and utilize them to cluster words.
